Describe subtasks in 5-minute increments.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - READ CAREFULLY:**
1. You MUST output ONLY the subtask list in the exact format shown below.
2. Do NOT add any explanations, comments, answers, or any additional text before or after the subtasks.
3. Do NOT include any preface like "Answer:" or "Here are the subtasks:".
4. Start your response immediately with "1) " followed by the first subtask.
5. If you notice any conflicts or ambiguities in the input, resolve them internally and still output in the required format.
